# DRL_Searcher
## Overview

DRL_Searcher employs distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve the multi-robot efficient search(MuRES) problem in a graph-represented environment. The main contributions:

- DRL-Searcher serves as a **unified** solution to The Multi-Robot Efficient Search (MuRES) problem;
- DRL-Searcher is **fast** in the online decision-making stage and adaptive with real-time environmental feedback;
- DRL-Searcher provides a **model-free** solution to MuRES problem.
